# What is machine learning?
Fundamentally, machine learning involves building mathematical models to help understand data. The "learning" process arises when we give these models tunable parameters that can be adapted to observed data; the program can be considered to be "learning" from the data. Once these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data. Alike the human brain, the more training algorithms get, the likelihood of better performance increases.
